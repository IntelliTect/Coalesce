Debugging & Environment Configuration
=====================================

## Debugging

### To Debug Code Generation
There are two ways to debug the code generation. The first is much easier, but can occasionally break due to Visual Studio file-locking necessary assemblies as part of background msbuild activity. The second requires a bit more work each time debugging is started, but is more reliable if you do run into file access errors. 

#### Option 1
1. Set IntelliTect.Coalesce.Cli as the startup project in Visual Studio.
2. Launch with debugging as you would with any other project.

#### Option 2
1. Run the `gulp` task called `coalesce:debug`. This will compile and launch the CLI tool.
2. Once the CLI tool starts, it will wait for 60 seconds for you to attach the Visual Studio debugger.
3. Attach the debugger to the PID specified in the `gulp` task output.

In either case, and depending on what is being diagnosed, the default Exception Settings may have to be changed to break on a specific or all CLR exceptions in order to find the issue. Breakpoints can be placed in any code as expected, including inside the .cshtml template files.

### To Debug TypeScript
* Generally, you will have the most success with Chrome
* The [KnockoutJS](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/knockoutjs-context-debugg/oddcpmchholgcjgjdnfjmildmlielhof) Context Debugger is very helpful for seeing what's happening at runtime with your Knockout bindings.

### To Debug controller run-time behavior
* Set breakpoints in either generated controllers, or in your own custom controllers.

## Environment Configuration
* Visual Studio 2017 15.5.* (any edition).  Get it [here](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/).
* .NET Core 2.0.* SDK.  Get it [here](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/windows).
* .NET Framework 4.6.2.  Get it [here](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/windows) (if you didn't install it with Visual Studio).
* An internet browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox -- all are known to work).
* You can use the Git source control client built into Visual Studio.
