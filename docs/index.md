# Coalesce

Designed to help you quickly build amazing web applications, Coalesce is a rapid-development code generation framework, created by [IntelliTect](https://intellitect.com) and built on top of:

- ASP.NET Core
- EF Core
- TypeScript
- [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) or [Knockout](https://knockoutjs.com/)


## What do I do?

You are responsible for the interesting parts of your application:

-  Data Model
-  Business Logic
-  External Integrations
-  Page Content
-  Site Design
-  Custom Scripting

## What is done for me?

Coalesce builds the part of your application that are mundane and
monotonous to build:

- Client side [TypeScript ViewModels](/stacks/disambiguation/view-model.md) for either [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) or [Knockout](https://knockoutjs.com/) that mirror your data model for both [lists](/stacks/disambiguation/list-view-model.md) and [individual objects](/stacks/disambiguation/view-model.md). Utilize these to rapidly build out your application's various pages.
- APIs to interact with your models via endpoints like List, Get, Save, and more.
- Out-of-the-box [Vue Components](/stacks/vue/coalesce-vue-vuetify/overview.md) or [Knockout bindings](/stacks/ko/client/bindings.md) for common controls like dates, selecting objects via drop downs, enums, etc. Dropdowns support searching and paging automatically.
-  A complete set of admin pages are provided, allowing you to read, create, edit, and delete data straight away without writing any additional code.


# Getting Started

To get started with Coalesce, check out [Getting Started with Vue](/stacks/vue/getting-started.md).

While Knockout.js is still supported by Coalesce, it is a deprecated option and not recommended for new projects. If you do still want to choose Knockout, click [here](/stacks/ko/getting-started.md).
