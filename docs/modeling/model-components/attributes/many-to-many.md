# [ManyToMany]

Used to specify a Many to Many relationship. Because EF core does not
support automatic intermediate mapping tables, this field is used to
allow for direct reference of the many-to-many collections from the
ViewModel.

The named specified in the attribute will be used as the name of a collection of the objects on the other side of the relationship in the generated [TypeScript ViewModels](/stacks/disambiguation/view-model.md). 

## Example Usage

``` c#
public class Person
{
    public int PersonId { get; set; }
    public string FirstName { get; set; }
    public string LastName { get; set; }

    [ManyToMany("Appointments")]
    public ICollection<PersonAppointment> PersonAppointments { get; set; }
}
```

## Properties

<Prop def="public string CollectionName { get; }" ctor="1" />

The name of the collection that will contain the set of objects on the other side of the many-to-many relationship.
