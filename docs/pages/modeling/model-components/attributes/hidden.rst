.. _HiddenAttribute:

[Hidden]
========

Mark an property as hidden from the edit, List or All areas.

    .. caution::
   
        This attribute is **not a security attribute** - it only affects the HTML of the generated views. It has no impact on data visibility in the API.

        Do not use it to keep certain data private - use the :ref:`SecurityAttribute` family of attributes for that.
   

Example Usage
-------------

    .. code-block:: c#

        public class Person
        {
            public int PersonId { get; set; }

            [Hidden(HiddenAttribute.Areas.All)]
            public int? IncomeLevelId { get; set; }
        }
