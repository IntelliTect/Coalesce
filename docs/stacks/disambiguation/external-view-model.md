# TypeScript External ViewModels

This is a disambiguation page for a concept in Coalesce that is implemented differently between the available front-end stack choices. Please select your preferred stack.

## Vue
    
The Vue stack for Coalesce does not create dedicated ViewModels for [External Types](/modeling/model-types/external-types.md). The interfaces in the [Model Layer](/stacks/vue/layers/models.md) are used as the only representation of [External Types](/modeling/model-types/external-types.md) on the client.

## Knockout
    
See: [TypeScript External ViewModels](/stacks/ko/client/external-view-model.md)
