            to the LoginPath as a query string parameter named by the ReturnUrlParameter. Once a request to the
            LoginPath grants a new SignIn identity, the ReturnUrlParameter value is used to redirect the browser back  
            to the url which caused the original unauthorized status code.

            when a 401 Unauthorized status code is changed to a 302 redirect onto the login path. This is also the query 
            string parameter looked for when a request arrives on the login path or logout path, in order to return to the 
            original url after the action is performed.
