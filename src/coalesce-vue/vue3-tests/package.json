  "description": "Development only package for coalesce-vue for Vue3. Runs tests for vue3 against the polyglot package coalesce-vue. This exists because we have to install conflicting versions of vue, vue-router, and test-utils. NPM still enforces peerDependencies even when using aliased package names, which prevents us from installing them as aliases in the parent project.",
